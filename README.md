# Simple Stress Tool

It's a simple self grpc stress testing tool
You can deploy client and server on your own kubernetes cluster to test.
It will set an k8s cronjob to do stress test. (once per 5 minutes)


## Run a simple ping pong GRPC Server

```bash
go run server/main.go
```

or 

```bash
./server/server
```

## Run Client to stress test

```bash
go run client/main.go {...arguments}
```

or 
```bash
./client/client {...arguments}
```

Heer's argument usages

```
  -addr string
        the address to connect to (default "localhost:50051")
  -concurrent int
        the number of concurrent requests (default 2)
  -frequency int
        the frequency of requests per second (default 1)
```

## Build

You can run make to build client and server command

```bash
    make
```

## Build Docker

You can build server/client docker images by make

```bash
    make build-client-docker
    make build-server-docker
```

## Deploy to kubernetes

Before deploy to k8s, you need to configure you k8s credentials first.
Then use ```make deploy``` to deploy

```bash
    make deploy
```

## Configure Frequency and Concurrent by k8s yaml

You can update fields in deployments/k8s/client.yaml to change frequency and concurrent

Here's the fields

```
spec.JobTemplate.spec.template.containers[].args
```

## Read the Metrics results

It's only support k8s log now.
I recommand you to use k8s to read the cronjob result.
